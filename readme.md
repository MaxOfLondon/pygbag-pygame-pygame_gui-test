# Test of pygame_gui with pygbag (linux)

This is a test boilerplate setup for pygme_gui and python webassembly using pygbag.

I found that browser hangs on `Setting [pygame_gui] up` and want to have starting point to work on the solution.

To run the test `chmod +x run.sh` then `source run.sh .venv`

Script will install virtualenv and dependencies then execute `main.py` without and with pygbag.

To see debug from webassembly navigate to http://localhost:8000/#debug
